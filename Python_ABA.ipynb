      "Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.\n",
      "[3][4][5] Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.\n",
      "[6][7][8] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral.\n",
      "Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens, or other such reward mechanisms.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n",
      "[10] When a cryptocurrency is minted, created prior to issuance, or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized.\n",
      "When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.\n",
      "As of June 2023, there were more than 25,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.\n",
      "[12] Throughout their existence, cryptocurrencies have been involved in criminal activities and multi-billion-dollar fraud schemes.\n",
      "Some economists and investors, such as Warren Buffett, considered cryptocurrencies to be a speculative bubble.\n",
      "[13][14] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[15] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments.\n",
      "Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient.\n",
      "This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.\n",
      "In 1998, Wei Dai described \"b-money\", an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.\n",
      "[19] Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published.\n",
      "In January 2009, Bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.\n",
      "[20][21] In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS.\n",
      "In October 2011, Litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256.\n",
      "Peercoin, created in August 2012, used a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.\n",
      "On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they could play in the UK economy.\n",
      "The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.\n",
      "In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, after the Legislative Assembly had voted 62–22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such.\n",
      "In August 2021, Cuba followed with Resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n",
      "This completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within China.\n",
      "On 15 September 2022, the world's second largest cryptocurrency at that time, Ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in an upgrade process known as \"the Merge\".\n",
      "On 11 November 2022, FTX Trading Ltd., a cryptocurrency exchange, which also operated a crypto hedge fund, and had been valued at $18 billion,[32] filed for bankruptcy.\n",
      "[33] The financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate FTX customer base, as reported,[34] while, at a Reuters conference, financial industry executives said that \"regulators must step in to protect crypto investors.\n",
      "\"[35] Technology analyst Avivah Litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that \"everything...needs to improve dramatically in terms of user experience, controls, safety, customer service.\n",
      "Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets other than Bitcoin are collectively known as alternative cryptocurrencies,[39][40][41] typically shortened to \"altcoins\" or \"alt coins\",[42][43] or disparagingly \"shitcoins\".\n",
      "[44] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal also described altcoins as \"alternative versions of Bitcoin\"[45] given its role as the model protocol for altcoin designers.\n",
      "Altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to Bitcoin.\n",
      "For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than Bitcoin.\n",
      "[46] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.\n",
      "[47] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.\n",
      "Significant rallies across altcoin markets are often referred to as an \"altseason\".\n",
      "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power.\n",
      "[52] Notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg.\n",
      "For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents.\n",
      "In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency.\n",
      "[citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it.\n",
      "The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "Within a proof-of-work system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners.\n",
      "Miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme.\n",
      "[59] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.\n",
      "The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain.\n",
      "[61] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.\n",
      "It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".\n",
      "Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.\n",
      "Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.\n",
      "The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNote, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.\n",
      "It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.\n",
      "On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions.\n",
      "For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward.\n",
      "The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "[65] This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009.\n",
      "[65] Mining is measured by hash rate typically in TH/s.\n",
      "With more people entering the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance.\n",
      "By July 2019, Bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by Switzerland.\n",
      "Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block.\n",
      "As of February 2018[update], the Chinese Government has halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining.\n",
      "Many Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada[69] and Texas.\n",
      "[70] One company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices.\n",
      "[72] According to a February 2018 report from Fortune, Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.\n",
      "The country built a compound containing 50,000 computers near Ekibastuz.\n",
      "[76] The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes.\n",
      "Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.\n",
      "Another popular card, the GTX 1060 (6 GB model) was released at an MSRP of $250, and sold for almost $500.\n",
      "At one point Intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip, named Blockscale.\n",
      "A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "There exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet.\n",
      "These methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.\n",
      "Bitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").\n",
      "[84] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash, and CryptoNote, implement additional measures to increase privacy, such as by using zero-knowledge proofs.\n",
      "A recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "In order to improve privacy, researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the IP address of the source.\n",
      "Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners.\n",
      "There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.\n",
      "By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power.\n",
      "The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate public blockchain.\n",
      "Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution.\n",
      "The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 million per year.\n",
      "This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n",
      "Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether.\n",
      "[citation needed] The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest.\n",
      "[citation needed] Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies[98] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n",
      "Crypto marketplaces do not guarantee that an investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price.\n",
      "Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange.\n",
      "An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation.\n",
      "However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation.\n",
      "In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often Bitcoin or Ether.\n",
      "According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used Switzerland as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations.\n",
      "The Swiss regulatory agency FINMA stated that it would take a \"balanced approach\" to ICO projects and would allow \"legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\"\n",
      "The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by Bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to Bitcoin.\n",
      "Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of Bitcoin itself.\n",
      "As the date reaches near of a halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks.\n",
      "The falls were attributed to warnings about inflation.\n",
      "There are also centralized databases, outside of blockchains, that store crypto market data.\n",
      "Compared to the blockchain, databases perform fast as there is no verification process.\n",
      "Four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, BraveNewCoin, and Cryptocompare.\n",
      "According to Alan Feuer of The New York Times, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind Bitcoin.\n",
      "Early Bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: \"At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons.\n",
      "\"[116] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are \"something of a cult\" based in \"paranoid fantasies\" of government power.\n",
      "David Golumbia says that the ideas influencing Bitcoin advocates emerge from right-wing extremist movements such as the Liberty Lobby and the John Birch Society and their anti-Central Bank rhetoric, or, more recently, Ron Paul and Tea Party-style libertarianism.\n",
      "[118] Steve Bannon, who owns a \"good stake\" in Bitcoin, sees cryptocurrency as a form of disruptive populism, taking control back from central authorities.\n",
      "Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, has supported the idea that cryptocurrencies go well with libertarianism.\n",
      "The rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users.\n",
      "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as \"virtual asset service providers\" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements as financial institutions.\n",
      "In May 2020, the Joint Working Group on interVASP Messaging Standards published \"IVMS 101\", a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between VASPs.\n",
      "In June 2020, FATF updated its guidance to include the \"Travel Rule\" for cryptocurrencies, a measure which mandates that VASPs obtain, hold, and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers.\n",
      "[125] Subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using JSON for relaying data between VASPs and identity services.\n",
      "As of December 2020, the IVMS 101 data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it.\n",
      "The European Commission published a digital finance strategy in September 2020.\n",
      "This included a draft regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the EU.\n",
      "On 10 June 2021, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses.\n",
      "The IMF is seeking a coordinated, consistent and comprehensive approach to supervising cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "Tobias Adrian, the IMF's financial counsellor and head of its monetary and capital markets department said in a January 2022 interview that \"Agreeing global regulations is never quick.\n",
      "In September 2017, China banned ICOs to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window.\n",
      "On 18 May 2021, China banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services.\n",
      "[132] Proof of work mining was the next focus, with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n",
      "On 9 June 2021, El Salvador announced that it will adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first country to do so.\n",
      "At present, India neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market.\n",
      "[135][136][137][138] Since then, an investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate, though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime.\n",
      "But it is being contemplated that the Indian Parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in India.\n",
      "[139] Expressing his public policy opinion on the Indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy lawyer and Vice President of SAARCLAW (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law) Hemant Batra has said that the \"cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment\".\n",
      "[140] He mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it.\n",
      "He favoured following IMF and FATF guidelines in this regard.\n",
      "[141] The largest scam occurred in April 2021, where the two founders of an African-based cryptocurrency exchange called Africrypt, Raees Cajee and Ameer Cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of Bitcoin.\n",
      "[142] Additionally, Mirror Trading International disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in January 2021.\n",
      "In March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets.\n",
      "This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges to be registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea.\n",
      "[143] Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts.\n",
      "It also requires that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks.\n",
      "FINMA, the Swiss regulator, issued its own guidance to VASPs in 2019.\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, as of 10 January 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the UK market must register with the Financial Conduct Authority.\n",
      "In 2021, 17 states passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation.\n",
      "[148] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering what steps to take.\n",
      "On 5 August 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler responded to Senator Elizabeth Warren's letter regarding cryptocurrency regulation and called for legislation focused on \"crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms,\" because of how vulnerable the investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker.\n",
      "He also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight.\n",
      "Additionally, Gensler did not hold back in his criticism of stablecoins.\n",
      "These tokens, which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies, may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems, such as anti-money laundering, tax compliance, and sanctions.\n",
      "ProShares CEO Michael L. Sapir said the ETF would expose Bitcoin to a wider range of investors without the hassle of setting up accounts with cryptocurrency providers.\n",
      "The United States Department of the Treasury, on 20 May 2021, announced that it would require any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service since cryptocurrency already posed a problem where illegal activity like tax evasion was facilitated broadly.\n",
      "This release from the IRS was a part of efforts to promote better compliance and consider more severe penalties for tax evaders.\n",
      "On 17 February 2022, the Justice department named Eun Young Choi as the first director of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to aid in identification of and dealing with misuse of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.\n",
      "On one hand, officials were hesitant to restrict the growing and profitable industry.\n",
      "On the other hand, they were committed to preventing illegal cryptocurrency transactions.\n",
      "To reconcile these conflicting goals, on 9 March 2022, President Biden issued an executive order.\n",
      "[153] Followed by the executive order, on 16 September 2022, the Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets document was released [154] to support development of cryptocurrencies and restrict their illegal use.\n",
      "Though this might not address all of the challenges in crypto industry, it was a significant milestone in the U.S. cryptocurrency regulation history.\n",
      "In February 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that cryptocurrency exchange Kraken's estimated $42 billion in staked assets globally operated as an illegal securities seller.\n",
      "The case would impact other major crypto exchanges operating staking programs.\n",
      "On 23 March 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an alert to investors stating that firms offering crypto asset securities may not be complying with U.S. laws.\n",
      "The SEC stated that unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities may not include important information.\n",
      "The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them.\n",
      "At least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.\n",
      "According to the Library of Congress in 2021, an \"absolute ban\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in 9 countries: Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, and the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 39 countries or regions, which include: Bahrain, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Gabon, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lesotho, Macau, Maldives, Mali, Moldova, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Republic of Congo, Saudi Arabia, Sengeal, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Qatar and Vietnam.\n",

      "Therefore, virtual currencies are considered commodities subject to capital gains tax.\n",
      "As the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009,[173] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society.\n",
      "Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money.\n",
      "Money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers, however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least provide a proven identity.\n",
      "Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals.\n",
      "Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.\n",
      "Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency makes legal enforcement against extremist groups more complicated, which consequently strengthens them.\n",

      "A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto[a] is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.\n",
      "Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.\n",
      "[3][4][5] Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.\n",
      "[6][7][8] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake.\n",
      "Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens, or other such reward mechanisms.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n",
      "When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.\n",
      "The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009.\n",
      "As of June 2023, there were more than 25,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.\n",
      "[12] Throughout their existence, cryptocurrencies have been involved in criminal activities and multi-billion-dollar fraud schemes.\n",
      "Some economists and investors, such as Warren Buffett, considered cryptocurrencies to be a speculative bubble.\n",

      "In January 2009, Bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.\n",
      "In October 2011, Litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256.\n",

      "Altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to Bitcoin.\n",
      "[46] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.\n",
      "[47] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.\n",
      "[48] In 2016, it had the largest \"following\" of any altcoin, according to the New York Times.\n",

      "For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly stated.\n",
      "In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency.\n",
      "[citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it.\n",
      "The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "Within a proof-of-work system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners.\n",
      "Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.\n",
      "[59] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.\n",
      "The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain.\n",
      "A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.\n",
      "[58][60] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[60] a timestamp and transaction data.\n",
      "[62] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks.\n",
      "Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.\n",
      "Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.\n",
      "A node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network.\n",
      "The node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either relaying transactions, validation, or hosting a copy of the blockchain.\n",
      "In terms of relaying transactions, each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports.\n",
      "When a transaction is made, the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.\n",
      "Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n",
      "The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme.\n",
      "The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNote, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.\n",
      "Another method is called the proof-of-stake scheme.\n",
      "Proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency.\n",
      "It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions.\n",
      "The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there is currently no standard form of it.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.\n",
      "On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions.\n",
      "For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward.\n",
      "The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network.\n",
      "The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "[65] Mining is measured by hash rate typically in TH/s.\n",
      "By July 2019, Bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by Switzerland.\n",

      "Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.\n",
      "[77] A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1,100.\n",
      "Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as soon as they are available.\n",
      "Nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners.\n",
      "A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.\n",
      "These methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.\n",
      "Bitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").\n",
      "[83] Thereby, Bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain.\n",
      "[84] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash, and CryptoNote, implement additional measures to increase privacy, such as by using zero-knowledge proofs.\n",
      "A recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "In order to improve privacy, researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the IP address of the source.\n",
      "Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners.\n",
      "There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.\n",
      "The rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution.\n",
      "Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case.\n",
      "The current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities.\n",
      "[91] In 2018, Bitcoin's design caused a 1.4% welfare loss compared to an efficient cash system, while a cash system with 2% money growth has a minor 0.003% welfare cost.\n",
      "The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 million per year.\n",
      "This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n",
      "However, the efficiency of the Bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees.\n",
      "Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction.\n",
      "For Ethereum, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while Bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies[98] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n",
      "As a result, as of 2020 it was possible to arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets.\n",

      "[44] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal also described altcoins as \"alternative versions of Bitcoin\"[45] given its role as the model protocol for altcoin designers.\n",
      "Altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to Bitcoin.\n",
      "For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than Bitcoin.\n",
      "[46] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.\n",
      "[47] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.\n",
      "Significant rallies across altcoin markets are often referred to as an \"altseason\".\n",
      "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power.\n",

      "Within a proof-of-work system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners.\n",
      "Miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme.\n",
      "[59] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.\n",
      "The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain.\n",
      "[61] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.\n",

      "Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.\n",
      "Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.\n",
      "The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNote, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.\n",
      "It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.\n",
      "On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions.\n",
      "For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward.\n",
      "The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "[65] This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009.\n",
      "[65] Mining is measured by hash rate typically in TH/s.\n",
      "With more people entering the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance.\n",
      "By July 2019, Bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by Switzerland.\n",

      "A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "There exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet.\n",
      "These methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.\n",
      "Bitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").\n",
      "[84] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash, and CryptoNote, implement additional measures to increase privacy, such as by using zero-knowledge proofs.\n",

      "In order to improve privacy, researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the IP address of the source.\n",
      "Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners.\n",
      "There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.\n",
      "By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power.\n",
      "The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate public blockchain.\n",
      "Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution.\n",
      "The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 million per year.\n",
      "This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n",
      "Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether.\n",
      "[citation needed] The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest.\n",
      "[citation needed] Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies[98] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n",
      "Crypto marketplaces do not guarantee that an investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price.\n",

      "An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation.\n",
      "However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation.\n",
      "In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often Bitcoin or Ether.\n",
      "According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used Switzerland as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations.\n",

      "A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto[a] is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.\n",
      "Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.\n",
      "[3][4][5] Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.\n",
      "[6][7][8] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake.\n",
      "Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens, or other such reward mechanisms.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n",
      "When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.\n",
      "The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009.\n",
      "As of June 2023, there were more than 25,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.\n",
      "[12] Throughout their existence, cryptocurrencies have been involved in criminal activities and multi-billion-dollar fraud schemes.\n",
      "Some economists and investors, such as Warren Buffett, considered cryptocurrencies to be a speculative bubble.\n",
      "[13][14] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[15] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments.\n",

      "In January 2009, Bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.\n",
      "In October 2011, Litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256.\n",

      "Altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to Bitcoin.\n",
      "[46] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.\n",
      "[47] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.\n",
      "[48] In 2016, it had the largest \"following\" of any altcoin, according to the New York Times.\n",
      "[52] Notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg.\n",
      "For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly stated.\n",
      "In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency.\n",
      "[citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it.\n",
      "The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
      "Within a proof-of-work system such as Bitcoin, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners.\n",
      "Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.\n",
      "[59] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.\n",
      "The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain.\n",
      "A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.\n",
      "[58][60] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[60] a timestamp and transaction data.\n",
      "[62] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks.\n",
      "Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.\n",
      "Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.\n",
      "A node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network.\n",
      "The node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either relaying transactions, validation, or hosting a copy of the blockchain.\n",
      "In terms of relaying transactions, each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports.\n",
      "When a transaction is made, the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.\n",
      "Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n",
      "The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme.\n",
      "The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNote, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.\n",
      "Another method is called the proof-of-stake scheme.\n",
      "Proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency.\n",
      "It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions.\n",
      "The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there is currently no standard form of it.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.\n",
      "On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions.\n",
      "For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward.\n",
      "The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network.\n",
      "The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.\n",
      "[65] Mining is measured by hash rate typically in TH/s.\n",
      "By July 2019, Bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by Switzerland.\n",
      "Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block.\n",
      "[72] According to a February 2018 report from Fortune, Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.\n",
      "An increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017.\n",
      "[76] The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes.\n",
      "Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.\n",
      "[77] A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1,100.\n",
      "Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as soon as they are available.\n",
      "Nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners.\n",
      "A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.\n",
      "These methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.\n",
      "Bitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").\n",
      "[83] Thereby, Bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain.\n",
      "[84] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash, and CryptoNote, implement additional measures to increase privacy, such as by using zero-knowledge proofs.\n",
      "A recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "In order to improve privacy, researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the IP address of the source.\n",
      "Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners.\n",
      "There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.\n",
      "The rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution.\n",
      "Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case.\n",
      "The current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities.\n",
      "[91] In 2018, Bitcoin's design caused a 1.4% welfare loss compared to an efficient cash system, while a cash system with 2% money growth has a minor 0.003% welfare cost.\n",
      "The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 million per year.\n",
      "This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n",
      "However, the efficiency of the Bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees.\n",
      "Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction.\n",
      "For Ethereum, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while Bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit.\n",
      "Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.\n",
      "Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies[98] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n",
      "As a result, as of 2020 it was possible to arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets.\n",
      "Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange.\n",
      "Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first Bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014.\n",
      "An initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture.\n",
      "However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation.\n",
      "In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often Bitcoin or Ether.\n",
      "The Swiss regulatory agency FINMA stated that it would take a \"balanced approach\" to ICO projects and would allow \"legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\"\n",
      "The market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation.\n",
      "The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by Bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to Bitcoin.\n",
      "The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the \"halving\", which is when the block rewards received from Bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into Bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of Bitcoin.\n",
      "As the date reaches near of a halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.\n",
      "For example, over one week in May 2022, Bitcoin lost 20% of its value and Ethereum lost 26%, while Solana and Cardano lost 41% and 35% respectively.\n",
      "In the longer term, of the 10 leading cryptocurrencies identified by the total value of coins in circulation in January 2018, only four (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Ripple (XRP)) were still in that position in early 2022.\n",

      "[139] Expressing his public policy opinion on the Indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy lawyer and Vice President of SAARCLAW (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law) Hemant Batra has said that the \"cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment\".\n",
      "[140] He mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it.\n",
      "He favoured following IMF and FATF guidelines in this regard.\n",

      "In March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets.\n",
      "This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges to be registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea.\n",
      "[143] Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts.\n",
      "It also requires that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks.\n",
      "FINMA, the Swiss regulator, issued its own guidance to VASPs in 2019.\n",

      "On 8 July 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren, part of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to the chairman of the SEC and demanded answers on cryptocurrency regulation due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this posed to consumers.\n",
      "On 5 August 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler responded to Senator Elizabeth Warren's letter regarding cryptocurrency regulation and called for legislation focused on \"crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms,\" because of how vulnerable the investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker.\n",
      "He also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight.\n",
      "These tokens, which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies, may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems, such as anti-money laundering, tax compliance, and sanctions.\n",
      "On 19 October 2021, the first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) from ProShares started trading on the NYSE under the ticker \"BITO.\"\n",
      "Ian Balina, the CEO of Token Metrics, stated that the approval of the \"BITO\" ETF by the SEC was a significant endorsement for the crypto industry because many regulators globally were not in favor of crypto as well as the hesitance to accept crypto from retail investors.\n",
      "This event would eventually open more opportunities for new capital and new people in this space.\n",
      "The United States Department of the Treasury, on 20 May 2021, announced that it would require any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service since cryptocurrency already posed a problem where illegal activity like tax evasion was facilitated broadly.\n",
      "This release from the IRS was a part of efforts to promote better compliance and consider more severe penalties for tax evaders.\n",
      "[153] Followed by the executive order, on 16 September 2022, the Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets document was released [154] to support development of cryptocurrencies and restrict their illegal use.\n",
      "The executive order included all digital assets, but cryptocurrencies posed both the greatest security risks and potential economic benefits.\n",
      "Though this might not address all of the challenges in crypto industry, it was a significant milestone in the U.S. cryptocurrency regulation history.\n",

      "As the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009,[173] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society.\n",
      "Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals.\n",
      "Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.\n",
      "Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money.\n",
      "Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions.\n",

      "According to a 2020 report produced by the United States Attorney General's Cyber-Digital Task Force, the following three categories make up the majority of illicit cryptocurrency uses: \"(1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; or (3) crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.\"\n",
      "The report concludes that \"for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential, it is imperative that these risks be addressed\" and that \"the government has legal and regulatory tools available at its disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrency's illicit uses\".\n",
      "According to the UK 2020 national risk assessment—a comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risk in the UK—the risk of using cryptoassets such as Bitcoin for money laundering and terrorism financing is assessed as \"medium\" (from \"low\" in the previous 2017 report).\n",

      "This includes a cyberattack on Japanese crypto exchange Liquid that has been linked to North Korea.\n",
      "Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road.\n",
      "[174] The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then.\n",

      "Wash trading is a process, illegal in some jurisdictions, involving buyers and sellers being the same person or group, and may be used to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency or inflate volume artificially.\n",
      "[207] A study from 2019 concluded that up to 80% of trades on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be wash trades.\n",
      "[207] A 2019 report by Bitwise Asset Management claimed that 95% of all Bitcoin trading volume reported on major website CoinMarketCap had been artificially generated, and of 81 exchanges studied, only 10 provided legitimate volume figures.\n",

      "Cryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes[214] and economic bubbles,[215] such as housing market bubbles.\n",
      "[218] However, research in 2021 by the UK's financial regulator suggests such warnings either went unheard, or were ignored.\n",
      "Fewer than one in 10 potential cryptocurrency buyers were aware of consumer warnings on the FCA website, and 12% of crypto users were not aware that their holdings were not protected by statutory compensation.\n",
      "[219][220] Of 1,000 respondents between the ages of eighteen and forty, almost 70% falsely assumed cryptocurrencies were regulated, 75% of younger crypto investors claimed to be driven by competition with friends and family, 58% said that social media enticed them to make high risk investments.\n",
      "Many banks do not offer virtual currency services themselves and can refuse to do business with virtual currency companies.\n",
      "An October 2021 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Bitcoin suffers from systemic risk as the top 10,000 addresses control about one-third of all Bitcoin in circulation.\n",

      "Before June 2021, China was the primary location for Bitcoin mining.\n",
      "However, due to concerns over power usage and other factors, China forced out Bitcoin operations, at least temporarily.\n",
      "As a result, the United States promptly emerged as the top global leader in the industry.\n",
      "An example of a gross amount of electronic waste associated with Bitcoin mining operations in the US is a facility that located in Dalton, Georgia which is consuming nearly the same amount of electricity as the combined power usage of 97,000 households in its vicinity.\n",
      "Another example is that Riot Platforms operates a Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, which consumes approximately as much electricity as the nearby 300,000 households.\n",
      "This makes it the most energy-intensive Bitcoin mining operation in the United States.\n",
      "The world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, uses 62.56 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.\n",
      "[245] XRP is the world's most energy efficient cryptocurrency, using 0.0079 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.\n",
      "[247] Academics and researchers have used various methods for estimating the energy use and energy efficiency of blockchains.\n",
      "A study of the six largest proof-of-stake networks in May 2021 concluded:\n",
      "This equates to Polkadot consuming 7 times the electricity of an average U.S. home, Cardano 57 homes and Solana 200 times as much.\n",
      "The research concluded that PoS networks consumed 0.001% the electricity of the Bitcoin network.\n",
      "Variable renewable energy power stations could invest in Bitcoin mining to reduce curtailment, hedge electricity price risk, stabilize the grid, increase the profitability of renewable energy power stations and therefore accelerate transition to sustainable energy.\n",

      "A number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including UNICEF.\n",
      "However, in 2021, there was a backlash against donations in Bitcoin because of the environmental emissions it caused.\n",
      "Some agencies stopped accepting Bitcoin and others turned to \"greener\" cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "It said: \"As the amount of energy needed to run Bitcoin became clearer, this policy became no longer tenable.\n",
      "In 2022, the Ukrainian government raised over US$10,000,000 worth of aid through cryptocurrency following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "Therefore, it is debated whether anybody could even be sued for embezzlement of cryptocurrency if he/she had access to someone's wallet.\n",
      "However, in the law of obligations and contract law, any kind of object would be legally valid, but the object would have to be tied to an identified counterparty.\n",
      "However, as the more popular cryptocurrencies can be freely and quickly exchanged into legal tender, they are financial assets and have to be taxed and accounted for as such.\n",
      "In 2018, an increase in crypto-related suicides was noticed after the cryptocurrency market crashed in August.\n",
      "The situation was particularly critical in Korea as crypto traders were on \"suicide watch\".\n",
